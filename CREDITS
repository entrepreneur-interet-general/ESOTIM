This software was forked from Virgil Dupras' work on DupeGuru (https://github.com/hsoft/dupeguru). All I did was strip it down from its GUI and write a streamined Python script that uses DupeGuru's engine for simple file deduplication.

Below are the original credits mentioned by Virgil Dupras on DupeGuru's repository, as of March 18, 2018.
